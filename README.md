# dynamicserver (Jackson Gudorf and Noah Ponto)

This dynamic web server takes data of the United States's energy consumption for each state and displays it. There are 5 different forms of energy that the data keeps track of: Coal, Renewable, Petroleum, Nuclear, and Natural Gas. The database has input for each state going back to 1960. This server dynamically updates the pages by using templates for the three main pages: year, state, and energy. We also used SQLite3 to access and make queries to the database.
